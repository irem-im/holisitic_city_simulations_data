- (DaySim) demographics, land use and transport system characteristics
- (MOVES) vehicles characteristics, distribution, volume and speed, meteorology, road network characteristics
- (R-LINE) meteorology, road network characteristics, mobile source emissions
- (MATSim) activity demand, network capacity and time constraint
